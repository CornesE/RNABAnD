							<h1>Research lines</h1>
							<p align="justify" >We are developing experimental approaches to elucidate the biological roles of P granules, a prototypical liquid-like RNA condensate located in the perinuclear region of <i> Caenorhabditis elegans </i> germ cells. Identified over three decades ago, P granules are crucial for maintaining germ cell integrity and function. The presence of  perinuclear RNA condensates, such as P granules, is observed during animal gametogenesis and appears essential for fertility. However, despite their conservation across species, including humans, the precise biological significance of these structures remains largely unexplored.</p>

									<h3>A dynamic molecular process maintained over time</h3>
									</header>
									<p align="justify" > The biology of P granules is intricately connected to RNA. During germ cell differentiation, the formation of P granules relies on active RNA transcription and the activity of RNA helicases. Furthermore, P granules are rich in RNA-binding proteins involved in both post-transcriptional and transcriptional regulation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). These findings suggest that mRNAs are fundamental components of P granules, which may, in turn, serve as hubs for active mRNA regulation. To investigate the role of P granules in germline gene regulation, we are adapting spatial transcriptomic techniques to characterize their mRNA composition throughout various stages of germ cell differentiation. </p>

											<h3>RNA condensate interactions and the regulation of gene activity </h3>
									</header>
									<p align="justify" > Distinct molecular pathways spatially segregate into P granules and other RNA condensates within the perinuclear environment of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> germ cells. These germline condensates interact to form complex multi-condensate structures that dynamically evolve based on the cellular context. <a href="https://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/fulltext/S1534-5807(21)00989-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1534580721009898%3Fshowall%3Dtrue "><b> Our previous research</b></a> has shown that changes in multi-condensate configurations correlate with alterations in the activity of molecular pathways that regulate germline gene expression programs essential for fertility. To further investigate how multi-condensate organization influences germline gene regulation at the molecular level, we are employing methods such as genome editing, genetic screenings, and super-resolution microscopy.																	</div>

										<h3> <i>In vivo </i>Perturbation of P granule properties and functions </h3>
									</header>
									<p align="justify" >A fundamental unresolved question in the field of cellular condensates is whether and how their material properties contribute to their function. To explore this question, we are investigating ways to modify parameters that influence the behavior of molecules within P granules <i>in vivo</i>. Can we alter the internal molecular diffusion rates of P granules? How do these alterations affect the material properties of P granules? and their internal molecular activities? Do these changes impact cell function? We are currently trying to translate these types of questions into testable experimental frameworks.</p>
